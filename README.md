# s-SNOM_spectra
An open-source, standalone MATLAB application for calculating the near-field spectrum of bulk homogeneous uniaxial samples based on the spheroid model. The repository also includes a Jupyter notebook and MATLAB script versions for flexible and user-friendly workflows. The model is presented in the paper K.V. Voronin et al. "Quantitative Analytical Spheroid Model for Scattering-type Scanning Near-field Optical Spectroscopy".

The folder "MATLAB App project" contains all the files required to compile SNOM_Spectra.exe or s-SNOM Installer.exe. The application s-SNOM Installer.exe is compiled in MATLAB 2025a and does not require a MATLAB license. It allows Users to calculate the near-field spectrum of bulk homogeneous uniaxial samples based on the spheroid model of the tip. Users can set all geometrical parameters and dielectric permittivities of the materials.

Spheroid_model_spectra.m was used for calculations presented in the mentioned paper; spheroid_model_spectra.ipynb is the translation of the MATLAB script to Python.
